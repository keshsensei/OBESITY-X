# OBESITY-X
Obesity X was created by me in C# It has a variety of good options. It is a mixture of a Rat a Stub and some DDos featuresas both are really good. Using this as a stub, it is very hard to decompile as i spend 1 year and 2, 3 months on it being hard to decompile. (More features to it would be added soon)

# IMPORTANT
If your wondering "how can it be a Rat and a DDos when its designed as a stub" Well actually when you tick the options that a rat has (Features below) It compiles it as an application located in C:\Users\yourname\Downloads. if you dont want it located there you can just move it to where you want. (You can also tick stubs with this too because the system know what to compile as an exe and as an application) **USING A VM CORRUPTS THE SYSTEM**
